Video Transition Tool
This tool allows you to create a combined video from two input videos with a slide and fade-in transition between them. You can control the pace of the transition by adjusting the transition time parameter.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
OpenCV Python package (install with pip install opencv-python)
Usage
Place your input videos in the same directory as the script.
Run the script with python video_transition.py.
The script will prompt you to enter the file names of the two input videos.
The script will display the first video and wait for you to press a key to start the transition.
During the transition, the script will display a blended frame that fades in from the second video.
Once the transition is complete, the script will display the second video.
Press q to quit the script.
Parameters
You can adjust the following parameters in the script:

transition_time: The duration of the transition in seconds. Default is 1 second.
Notes
The script assumes that the two input videos have the same dimensions and frame rate. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the script to handle the videos appropriately.
The script does not save the output video to disk. You can modify the script to save the output video if desired.
